# USB CCID Emulator

The USB CCID Emulator forwards a locally present PC/SC smart card reader as a
standard USB CCID reader. USB CCID Emulator can be used as trusted intermediary
enabling secure PIN entry and PIN modification. In combination with
[OpenSC](https://github.com/frankmorgner/OpenSC) also PACE can be performed by
the emulator.

Please refer to [our project's website](http://frankmorgner.github.io/vsmartcard/ccid/README.html) for more information.
