Installation
************

The PC/SC Relay uses the GNU Build System to compile and install. If you are
unfamiliar with it, please have a look at :file:`INSTALL`. If you can not find
it, you are probably working bleeding edge in the repository.  Run the
following command in :file:`pcsc-relay` to get the missing standard
auxiliary files::
    
    autoreconf --verbose --install

To configure (:command:`configure --help` lists possible options), build and
install the PC/SC Relay now do the following::
    
    ./configure
    make
    make install
