# This is an example dataset file for the virtual smartcard.
# Datagroups are just given in plain ascii, separated by =.
# CommunityID has to be given as hex values enclosed with ' '.
# The File is passed to the virtual smartcard emulator via
# command line option -d, with or without path.
#
# Identifier '<NotOnChip>' as parameter value will trigger R-APDU "ERR_FILENOTFOUND" (0x6A82)
# which indicates in eID service "Attribute not on chip"
# since first versions of nPA / eAT did not have those data groups
# example: BirthName=<NotOnChip>
# This is applicable for ReligiousArtisticName, Nationality, BirthName, ResidencePermit1
# It may be used for other data groups as well, but makes no sence there
#
# Notice: Leading and trailing spaces in value (after equal sign) are part of value string!!!!
#

# DocumentType "ID" will be nPA, "AR" (and other) will be eAT
