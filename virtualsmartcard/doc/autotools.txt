Installation
************

The Virtual Smart Card uses the GNU Build System to compile and install. If you are
unfamiliar with it, please have a look at :file:`INSTALL`. If you can not find
it, you are probably working bleeding edge in the repository.  Run the
following command in :file:`virtualsmartcard` to get the missing standard
auxiliary files::
    
    autoreconf --verbose --install

To configure (:command:`configure --help` lists possible options), build and
install the Virtual Smart Card now do the following::
    
    ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc
    make
    make install
